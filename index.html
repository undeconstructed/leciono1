  <h1>Esperanto in 17 minutes</h1>

  <p class="p">(This is not an Esperanto course, but it should give an idea what the language is, and you could probably learn most of what you need from this and reading a few things.)</p>

  <p class="p">Esperanto is a set of word roots, and a system for arranging them, so that they can be used to complement each other. Let's begin.</p>

  <p class="p">Look out of the window. It's probably raining. The root is "pluv-".</p>

  <p class="p">Rain is a reason to say something. To say that it is raining, take the root "pluv-", and make it into a verb, by adding the ending that means "happening now": "-as".</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">pluvas</p>
    <p class="tr">it rains</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">That's a sentence. A sentence is built around a verb - that verb contains the reason for making the sentence, and a marker that says when that thing happens. There are five endings:</p>

  <div class="p">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>-is</td><td>happenend in the past</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-as</td><td>happening now</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-os</td><td>will probably happen in the future</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-us</td><td>happens in an imaginary world</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-u</td><td>someone wants it to happen</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Sometimes you want to say who or what is doing the verb. That's very easy - take the root for that thing, and make it a noun with the -o ending. A noun just dropped into a sentence is doing the verb:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">kato kuris</p>
    <p class="tr">a cat ran</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">If you want to use another concept to describe a noun, then take the root for the concept, and add -a to make it an adjective:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">blua kato dormos</p>
    <p class="tr">a blue cat will sleep</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Maybe there another concept that somehow relates to this action. Perhaps there's a place where it happens. To add another noun, you can introduce it with a preposition, to say how it relates to the action.</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">blua kato sidas antaŭ televidilo</p>
    <p class="tr">a blue cat is sitting in front of a TV (a "television tool")</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Sometimes there's no obvious preposition to choose, or maybe you just don't feel like it, so you can mark the noun (and its adjectives) with a -n ending, to say "you know what this is about".</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">kato ne ŝatas pluvon</p>
    <p class="tr">a cat doesn't like rain</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">By the way, because everything is neatly marked, you can shuffle the words around a bit:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">pluvon malvarman kato ne ŝatas</p>
    <p class="tr">a cat doesn't like cold (opposite-of-hot) rain</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">But don't go overboard with that, just use it when it makes the sentence easier to understand.</p>

  <p class="p">Sometimes you need to more specific than just "a cat" - you need to say which cat. The easiest option is to use "la", which means basically "you know the one."</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">la kato manĝas manĝaĵojn</p>
    <p class="tr">the cat eats food (eating-stuff)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Or maybe you want to say something more like "the one that we are talking about":</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">tiu kato ĉasus hundojn</p>
    <p class="tr">that cat would chase dogs</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">If you need to link several sentences together, you will need some words to do that. You'll always have one main sentence, as before, but related sentences will need an introduction, e.g.</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">tiu kato ĉasus hundojn, se ĝi trovus hundojn</p>
    <p class="tr">that cat would chase dogs, if it found dogs</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">tiu kato malŝatas hundojn, ĉar ili estas bruaj</p>
    <p class="tr">that cat dislikes (opposite of likes) dogs, because they are noisy</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">While we're in the mood, let's do all the pronouns:</p>

  <div class="p">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>mi</td><td>the person who's talking</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>vi</td><td>who they are talking to</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ĝi</td><td>another thing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>li</td><td>another male person</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ŝi</td><td>another female person</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ni</td><td>the speaker and their associates</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ili</td><td>some other people or things</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p class="p">But, you ask, "what about sex-neutrality?". Well, we'll come back to that later.</p>

  <p class="p">Okay, now we have a tricky bit coming up. Ready? Sometimes you want to link sentences together in a special way, where you take an idea from one sentence and kind of bring it into the other. There we use the word "kiu", which is like "tiu", but it is specifically for referring to an idea inside a new sentence:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">la kato, kiu ĉasas hundojn, estas feliĉa</p>
    <p class="tr">the cat, who chases dogs, is happy</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Hmm, is it clear enough that the "kiu" is about the cat? Yes, probably, but we can be explicit:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">la kato, kiu kato estas granda, estas dormema</p>
    <p class="tr">the cat, which is big, is sleepy (inclined to sleep)</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">In fact, we can pull any idea out the main sentence, and put it into a sub-sentence, we just have to say what type of thing it is:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi faris tion je la oka horo, je kiu tempo mi ridis</p>
    <p class="tr">I did that at 8 o'clock, at which time I laughed</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">In fact, there are some shortcuts you can use for this sort of thing:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi estas kontenta, kiam mi estas kun vi</p>
    <p class="tr">I am happy, when I am with you</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">We'll do the whole set of those words at some point, but just one more for now: Sometimes you just want to talk about a .. thing. It's maybe not clear what sort of thing is that thing, it's just a thing. Let's try that:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">kio estas tio? tio estas kato.</p>
    <p class="tr">what is that? that is a cat.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Oh yeah, those ki- words are also good for asking questions. Think of them as meaning "fill in the appropriate thing here", please. There's also a simple way to make a yes/no question:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">ĉu vi komprenas? jes .. kaj ne.</p>
    <p class="tr">do you understand? yes  .. and no.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Right, just one more big thing to cover. We'll start off easy, and then go nuts with it. If you want to describe something twice, e.g. with a type and a name, then just put them both in together:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mia amiko Tomaso estas tie.</p>
    <p class="tr">my friend Thomas is there.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">But what if you can't find a word for something? Well, you'll need to use a sentence. Think of the sentence as taking the place of a name: it's enough information to say what you're talking about, but in multiple words. So let's try:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi ŝatas la ideon ke katoj povu flugi.</p>
    <p class="tr">I like the idea that cats should be able to fly..</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">"la ideon" isn't enough information, because it doesn't say what that idea is, so we add a sentence that says what the idea is. The little word "ke" just says "here is a sentence coming up now". There's a lot that you can do with this, and there's scope for confusion, so let's try a couple of things:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi estas kontenta, pro tio ke vi estas ĉi tie</p>
    <p class="tr">I am happy, because of that thing that you are here</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Yeah, that isn't good english, but you get the idea? The word "tio" means "that thing", but what thing?! It doesn't say!! Well, that's why we added a sentence to explain. In fact, the "tio" isn't very interesting, we could possibly leave it out. For that matter, we might not need the "pro" either - you'd guess that this was about the cause of something, right? Maybe we could just say:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi estas kontenta ke vi estas ĉi tie</p>
    <p class="tr">I am happy that you are here</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">But remember! The more words you throw out, the higher the chance of everything exploding!</p>

  <p class="p">Speaking of leaving things out, there's a special kind of verb-thing, that isn't really a verb. If a word ends in "-i", then it's a sort of general idea of a verb. It's not happening, it's just sort of existing, and hinting that a full setence exists, but isn't being said. Try not to go overboard:</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">la kato volas dormi</p>
    <p class="tr">the cat wants to sleep</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">And finally, there are some things I can't be bothered to explain. They will certainly be confusing.</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">tio interesas min. mi interesiĝas.</p>
    <p class="tr">that interests me. I am interested.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">la kato bluiĝis, ĉar mi bluigis ĝin.</p>
    <p class="tr">the cat became blue, because I made it blue.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">And then there are participles. There are 6 of those, but you'll get the idea. Probably.</p>

  <div class="ekz">
    <p class="eo">mi estus farinta tion. mi estos faranta tion. finfine, tio estos farita,</p>
    <p class="tr">I would be having-done that. i will be doing that. finally, that will have been done.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Oh wait, I promised to talk about those ki- and ti- and neni- words, and then I didn't. In fact I never even mentioned neni- before now. Oh well, here's some word starts and ends, just put them together yourself:</p>

  <div class="p">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>that</td><td>ti-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>which</td><td>ki-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>any/some</td><td>i-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>no</td><td>neni-</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>every</td><td>ĉi-</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
        <td>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>-o</td><td>thing (this is a noun)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-u</td><td>individual (this is a sort of adjective)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-a</td><td>type (also, adjective)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-es</td><td>individual's (and again)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-el</td><td>manner (this one is an adverb)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-e</td><td>place (as are all the rest, sort of)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-am</td><td>time</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-al</td><td>reason</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>-om</td><td>amount</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p class="p">Yeah. That'll do.</p>
